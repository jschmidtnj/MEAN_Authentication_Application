# MEAN_Authentication_Application

use npm start in the angular-src file and in the meanauthenticationapp file to load localhost ports 3000 and 4200. 3000 is for the backend and 4200 is for the front end. This is for the raw MEAN stack.

The upload of the raw files did not work for some reason so I am including a link to a Google drive folder with the files in it. Feel free to download the whole thing...

For getting the mongodb database up and running, first download mongodb here: https://www.mongodb.com/download-center.
Then navigate to your mongodb folder (please use custom install to make the file paths easier), then mongodb\bin.
Then mongod --directoryperdb --dbpath C:\mongodb\data\db --logpath C:\mongodb\log\mongo.log --logappend --install.
Then netstartMongoDB.Then mongo.
Look here for the shell commands: https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.4/reference/mongo-shell/
